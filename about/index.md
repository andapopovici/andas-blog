<p>I'm a front-end software engineer currently building <a href="https://www.freeagent.com">FreeAgent's</a> Design System. </p>

<p>I enjoy thinking about the usability, accessibility and performance of the things
I build. I have a keen interest in design and how it can improve people's lives.</p>

<p>I'm learning about accessibility constantly and am a big fan of inclusive design. I believe starting with trying to include everyone and thinking about people's needs benefits all of us in the long run.</p>

<p>I live in Scotland and I have 2 Norwegian forest cats that keep me busy most of the time!</p>
