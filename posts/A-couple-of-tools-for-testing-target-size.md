This week I attended a workshop organised by the GOV.uk design system team where I learned more about the new [WCAG 2.2 Target size criterion](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#target-size-minimum).

One of the highlights were a couple of tools that were shared to help with testing this criterion:

* [a series of bookmarklets](https://accessibility-tools.github.io/target-size-highlighter/) built by one of the organisers, David Cox, which highlight interactive elements on a page; this is useful to have a quick overview of what there is to test on a page
* [Adrian Roselli's bookmarklet](https://codepen.io/aardrian/pen/rNqdJyO) for turning your mouse cursor into a 24x24px circle which helps with hovering over targets and measuring them

I've used these together and they work a treat. Sometimes I enable the highlighter bookmarklet on random websites just to see what interactive elements there are on the page. I know how to have fun!

Hope these are useful to you too!

I will leave you with the whole document of [resources from the workshop](https://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/trs/2006-11/2006-11.htm), including a [super interesting research](https://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/trs/2006-11/2006-11.htm) on optimal touch targets done in 2006.

Happy testing!
