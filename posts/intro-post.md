"Do you really want to share your life with the internet?" I asked myself again.

"Well, it's not really my _life_ life. There will be mostly professional things on here, you know - front-end, design, accessibility. That kind of stuff. And maybe cat pics once in a while. People love cats."

"Fine, let's get on with it!"

I hope you enjoy what I write on here, it's a work in progress. I'm trying to improve my writing skills, process new things I'm learning by explaining them back to someone (imaginary someone) and putting my voice out there because I am starting to believe I do have something to say!

Glad to have you here!
