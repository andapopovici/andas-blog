## TLDR;
I have an O'reilly books subscription through work and I tend to read books either on my iPad or iPhone. I found the app UX - particularly the "in-book" reading screen a bit frustrating at times so I tried to redesign it in a way that would work for me and potentially other readers.

## Analysis

In this article, I'll concentrate on the iOS app as that's the one I use more frequently. 

The app has the typical layout you would expect from a reading app. It shows you a list of books you've saved in your "playlist", as well as books you might be interested in at the start.

The UX starts to get annoying when you open up a book.

### The good

You can read a book. It does the job. However, let's continue with...

### The bad

Trying to customize your reading experience - from fonts to theme takes a bit of a mental energy when it should actually be super straight forward. Why does this happen?

#### Un-labelled icons

-- LET'S GUESS THE ICONS --

I know an iOS app has a limited amount of space, which might make it tricky to provide labels for all options.

I think the app is cramming too many un-labelled icons in a space that is not meant for them.

Also, the amount of times I've hit this icon thinking it's the Table of contents is...too MUCH!

Can you see how the icon on the right could be mistaken for the one on the left?

Both have a list of "things". At that size, I don't want to have to squint and realise - "Oh yeah, of course. That's the Playlist icon because it has numbers." I think we can do better.

If you NEED an icon for adding to a playlist, you should label it appropriately and make the picture somewhat unambiguous. How about a simple + sign?

#### One-time actions

Erik Kennedy talks about the [laws of locality](https://www.learnui.design/blog/the-3-laws-of-locality.html) a.k.a have the control next to the thing it affects. That makes sense. However, the O'reilly app is trying to show us ALL the actions you can take for a book.

Not all the possible actions for a book need to be crammed into the reading context. 


### The WTF

## Redesign approach

### Comparison

I've compared this to 2 other apps I use regularly on my phone - the Kindle app & a free reader called PocketBook. I enjoy reading on these so I tried to understand what about their UX I find appealing.

Good design is the one you don't notice because it doesn't get in the way. It's quietly helping you do your thing without telling you why.

### Conclusion
