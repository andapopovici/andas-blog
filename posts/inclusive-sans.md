I find choosing and combining fonts a bit of a chore. But, when I read about a new accessibility focussed font, I knew I had to try it.

I'm talking about Inclusive Sans, available from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inclusive+Sans?query=inclusive). The text you're reading right now is rendered using Inclusive Sans, and I find it very easy to read.

The [website of the font](https://www.oliviaking.com/inclusive-sans) lists all the thinking that went into designing this font and optimising for readability, such as having
a clear distinction between certain characters. I personally appreciate the clear distinction between 0 and O as that's not very apparent for a lot of fonts.

After a chat about dyslexia at the Accessibility forum at work, it seems like this sort of font can be useful for dyslexia. Another font that was shared around was [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont). I'm done with playing around with fonts for now though, and will be sticking with Inclusive Sans.
