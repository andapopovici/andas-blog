Even though I have accessibility knowledge that I acquired from different sources, I wanted a course that gave me a good foundation and boost my confidence going forward in my learning journey. So, I took the [Introduction to Web Accessibility course on the edX platform](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:W3Cx+WAI0.1x+3T2019/home) in summer/autumn of 2023.

The course itself is free, but you can pay to get a certificate. Here's [my certificate](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/b56086ae9769452092230e1806b2240e). The content of the course is adapted from W3C materials, which gave me confidence that it's useful information.

Some sections are more technical than others, but I think overall it's a general accessibility course for the web and it can be done by people in different roles and not just engineers and designers. There's a lot of information about building a case for accessibility and maintaining the culture that would be very well suited for project managers or other decision makers in an organisation.

I spent about 5 hours a week going through the materials and doing the quizzes. Each module has a quiz at the end, and the score counts towards your final score. I think the difficulty was about average, and I only struggled if there were sections I didn't pay attention to.

Things I liked about the course:

* emphasis on real people using assistive technology
* a variety of instructors from different organisations, including [Henny Swan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hennyswan/) who is now a Tetralogical director
* content is presented in different ways such as videos and text
* it's self paced, with the option to set a weekly learning goal to keep you motivated
* adding the certificate to LinkedIn is super easy

Things that could be improved:

* the course didn't work very well on the edX app on a phone or tablet, so I had to do it exclusively in a browser on a laptop
* some of the videos of people using assistive technology are quite out of date with older technolody, and it would be good to get updated versions of them

# Quick overview

## Module 1

A very gentle and real world introduction to accessibility. It emphasises that accessibility is about people and not standards and checklists.

## Module 2

This module is led by Henny Swan and isÂ based on [How People with Disabilities Use the Web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/). It explains different types of disabilities:

* physical and visual
* hearing and speech
* cognition and learning

and how people use assistive technology.

## Module 3

This module is based on the WAI resource [The Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/). It goes into the benefits that come from boosting accessibility in an organisation. The content was illustrated with a fake company use case, and I found the videos quite entertaining. I feel this content would benefit project/product managers a lot.

## Module 4

The most technical of the modules, as it goes into the 4 WCAG principles:

* perceivable
* operable
* understandable
* robust

It also defines the scope of other W3C accessibility standards, such as ATAG and UAAG.

This module also covers some WAI ARIA basics, but I found this section and the quiz a little bit confusing.

Some of the content in this module inspired me to write guidance at work regarding accessible blog posts for our engineering blog. It's got a lot of practical advice and is probably the most content rich module, so I would allow for more time for it.

## Module 5

The concluding module is all about planning and maintaining accessibility in your organisation, establishing policies and understanding that accessibility is an ongoing commitment. It's based on the W3C's [Planning and Managing Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning-and-managing/).

And that's the end of the course! This is a worthwile course in my opinion, with a lot of useful information and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a solid foundation in accessibility knowledge.
