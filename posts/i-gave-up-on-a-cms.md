Ever since I set up this blog, I have wanted to connect it to a CMS to make it easier for me to create or edit posts on the go. Sometimes I get ideas when I'm not using a laptop and I'd like to be able to write content on my phone instead.

This blog is running on Eleventy, and is deployed on Netlify.

I tried Tina CMS first, which was advertised as really easy to set up. The local setup was pretty straightforward and I got my admin UI running quickly. However, I ran into issues when trying to run Tina on Netlify. I tried all sorts of run scripts, each requiring a new push and re-deploy. After several of these experiments, I got frustrated and gave up. I probably spent a good few hours trying things out and was frustrated. So I left it and came back to it in a few weeks for another round of debugging. Nothing worked and I couldn't find any solutions online. It was time to give up.

The next one I tried was Netlify CMS as I had used it before at work and knew it integrates well with Netlify. After tinkering with the configuration and following a couple of tutorials, I realized Netlify CMS is no longer called Netlify CMS but Decap. So I changed tactic.
